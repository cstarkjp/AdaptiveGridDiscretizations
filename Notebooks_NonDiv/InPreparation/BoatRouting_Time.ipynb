    "In this notebook, we compute the optimal route for a boat under the following assumptions:\n",
    "- The objective is to minimize the fuel consumption, for a given the travel time.\n",
    "- The boat fuel consumption is locally a quadratic function of its relative velocity, w.r.t. water.\n",
    "- The boat total velocity is the sum of the relative velocity w.r.t water and of a drift due to water currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion of the assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions chosen above are a strong simplification of reality. Some of them may be relaxed, at the price of more complexity in the implementation. \n",
    "- Often the objective is to minimize fuel consumption subject to a window in the arrival dates.\n",
    "- The boat velocity model can be complexified. In fact, the method described below can handle any convex cost, approximated in a suitable manner. However, determining this cost (which depends on the physical properties of the boat), and approximating it (fitting a convex set with an intersection of ellipsoids), may raise difficulties in itself. \n",
    "- The problem considered here is time dependent. However, if time dependency is not a prerequisite for the application, then a much simpler and faster alternative numerical method can be considered, described in another notebook."
